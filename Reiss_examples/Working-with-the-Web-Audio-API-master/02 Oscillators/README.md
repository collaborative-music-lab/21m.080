# oscillators

This Chapter focuses on OscillatorNodes.

- OscillatorNode demonstrates use of the built-in oscillator types and varying the oscillator's frequency
- Detuning shows use of detuning the pitch and how it relates to musical notation.
- There are two examples of creating custom oscillators using the PeriodicWave.
  - creating a square wave
  - creating a pulse wave, which is like a square wave but with a duty cycle parameter which controls how much of its period it spends near its peak value.
