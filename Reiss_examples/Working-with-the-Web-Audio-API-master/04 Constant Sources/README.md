# Constant sources

The ConstantSourceNode represents an audio source whose output is a constant value. Examples are provided showing;

- DCoffset: applying a DC offset to an oscillator, which also demonstrates what happens when rendering audio outside the range -1 to +1
- ConstantSourceSquareWave: use of a constant source node to construct a square wave
- Grouping tracks: grouping tracks in a multitrack audio, and applying the same processing on all tracks in a groupwhen working with multitrack audio.
