# Parameter automation

Here, we dive into how audio parameters are set and scheduled in the Web Audio API.
There are 5 source code examples;
 
- Beep: Making a beep sound, a basic demonstration of audio parameter automation
- RepeatBeep:shows how parameter automation can be looped using JavaScript's setInterval method.
- SetValueCure: creates a beep sound using a custom automation curve
- Crossfade: Uses setValueCurveAtTime to show the difference between a linear crossfade and an equal power crossfade of two signals.
- Bells: we show how bell sounds can be created using additive synthesis, by applying envelopes to a set of oscillators.
