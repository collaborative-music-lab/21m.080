# Connecting audio parameters and modulation

Here, we look at how an audio nodeâ€™s output can be connected to a parameter of another node. There are two examples.

- FMSynthesis: shows how FM synthesis is performed by connecting a Low Frequency Oscillator to the frequency parameter of another oscillator.
- AMSynthesis: for implementing AM synthesis by connecting a Low Frequency Oscillator to the gain parameter of a gain node.
