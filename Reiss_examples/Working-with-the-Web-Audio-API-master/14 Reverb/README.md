# Reverb

These examples show use of the ConvolverNode to implement convolutional reverb.

- ConvolutionReverb: illustrates typical use of the convolver node, where a source is convolved with a simulated impulse response.
- NormalizeIR:  illustrates a minor issue with use of the ConvolverNode's normalize parameter. In this example, the impulse responses are stored in wav files.
