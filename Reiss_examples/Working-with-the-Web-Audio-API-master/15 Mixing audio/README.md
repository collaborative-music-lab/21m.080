# Mixing Audio

These code examples illustrate use of the ChannelMergerNode and ChannelSplitterNode, as well as how to perform connections to/from nodes with multiple inputs/outputs.

- ChannelFlip: shows how to flip the channels in a stereo audio stream.
- PingPongDelay: shows how a delay effect can 'bounce' delayed copies of a signal between left and right channels of an output audio stream. ChannelMerger is used to combine audio streams into stereo output.
