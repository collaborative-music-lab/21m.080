# Controls and connections 

The main controls for each operator are what you'd expect:
* the main frequency goes to the input of harmonicity (e.g. .harmonicity)
* set the harmonicity value using harmonicity.factor
* set the index using index.factor
* ADSR envelope parameters
* index_env_depth.factor lets the envelope add to the index

## output 
Each operator has an output vca, used to connect to other operators or to external Tone objects.

# Notes 

Notice that operators identified as carriers are slightly different:
* they won't have an index or index envelope
* they use an amplitude.value to set their amplitude

## Algorithms
DX7 style algorithms let you chain operators together. The algorithm in the example has the operators in series, with two modulators and one carrier:
* mod2 -> mod1 -> carrier

In this arrangement, any DC offset in mod1 will create a noticeable pitch sweep in the carrier. A DC offset is simply when a waveform spends more time above the zero centerline (or alternatively, below the centerline). This kind of waveform can occasionally be created using FM. 

One simple fix is to add a highpass filter between the oscillator and the output, with the filter's frequency being the same as the oscillator (e.g. harmonicity.connect( filter.frequency)).
This can happen when the waveform created by mod2 modulating mod1
