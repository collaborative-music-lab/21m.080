## Chorusing
A chorus effect attempts to make it sound like there are multiple instruments playing together. We can do this by adding a delayed copy of a signal, and then using an lfo to change the delay time in order to make it sounds like there are slight variations in timing.
* This doesn't really sound 'authentic' in the sense of creating a chorus of instruments, but it can still sound cool
* try: level: .8, feedback: .0, coarseTime: 5, fineTime: 240, lfoRate:2, lfoDepth:0.001
* try with the rhodes and ukulele sounds

## Flanging
Flanging is basically comb filtering with variable delay time. It works especially well with the delay feedback turned up a bit!
* Change audio to 120bpm_beat
* Generally, you want the lfo depth to about the same as the actual delay time. Remember, you can take a look at the javascript console to see the delay time generated by the coarse + fine knobs.
* Try: level: 1, feedback: .25, coarseTime: 1, fineTime: 170, lfoRate:.1, lfoDepth:0.004
* This works best with signals with a LOT of frequencies, e.g. lots of harmonics or noise elements
