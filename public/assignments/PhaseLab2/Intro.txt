Phase is often used to create interesting audio effects like chorusing and flanging. This example shows a few ways of doing this.

N.b. the audio effect called 'phasing' or 'phase shifting' also works by shifting phase, but generally not using a delay line. Instead, it often uses 'all-pass' filters, which let all frequencies pass with varying amounts of phase shift across the frequency spectrum.
