This example is pretty heavily influenced by the MiniMoog. The frequency of each oscillator is a combination of the octave control and the detune control. Notice that this requires using callbacks to query the value of both knobs every time.

The range of each oscillators octave and detune knobs are different, which is typical. Getting the sweep and range of knobs right can be an artform! I'm not 100% happy about this implementation, but it can get lots of nice sounds!
