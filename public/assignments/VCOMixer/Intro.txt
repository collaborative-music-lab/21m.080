Combining multiple oscillators in a subtractive synth is pretty common, typically to fatten the sound up. In an analog synth oscillators will never be perfectly in tune; in the digital worl we will need to manually detune our oscillators. 

The approach below just copy-and-pastes three oscillators. It might be easier to create oscillator arrays, or even defining a class for your oscillators (see the FMOperator example). But there is no reason you can't just keep it simple!
