Waveshaping is a great way to transform signals. This works by creating a *transfer function*, which maps values from [-1,1] of an incoming signal to new values based on the *transfer function's* shape.

This example shows two kinds of wavefolding, using a sine wave and a triangle wave, as well as implementing soft and hard clipping. Notice how easy it is to implement transfer functions - try experimenting with your own! Do note, though, that they need to have input and output values limited to [-1,1].

Also note that we use the amplitude of the signal going into the transfer function to determine how much of an effect the waveshapper has on the signal.
