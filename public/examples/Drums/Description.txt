# Kick Drum Synthesis

The basic elements of a kick drum sound are:
* a low frequency VCO, typically using a sine or triangle wave
* a pitch env to emulate the pitch drop associated with a beater hitting a drum head
* sometimes a tone shaping element to add higher harmonics at the beginning of the sound. Here we use a waveshaper to add soft clipping. The waveshaper is after the amplitude envelope, so there will be more clipping at the beginning of the note.

## variations

* Emulate a tom by changing the base oscillator frequency to be higher, and having a more pronounced pitch drop. 
* There are lots of other ways to emulate the beater hitting the drum head: adding a short noise burst, using FM or AM to add harmonics, etc. 
* In analog synthesis, it is also common to use a self-oscillating filter for the oscillator. Remember, a filter oscillating at its cutoff frequency is the easiest way to make a sine wave in analog synths!

# Hihat Synthesis

The basic elements of a hihat sound are a noise source going through a vca with a short envelope. You can experiment with different flavors of noise (blue noise, where the higher frequencies are accentuated, works well). I often just use white noise going through a highpass filter, tuned to taste.

It is typical to use a single hihat circuit, and just change the decay time for open and closed hihats. 

## variations

* For a more 'metallic' sound, you can take the approach Roland did in the TR-606, using a bank of six square wave oscillators, carefully tuned to NOT be harmonic. They also often include a noise oscillator as well. 
* You can also use multiple filters to further refine the sound. Adding a notch filter, for example, or a bandpass filter in parallel with the highpass filter.
* You can also have the vcf frequency change depending on how hard the note is played, or for open vs closed notes.
* To make a snare drum sound, try setting the filter frequency lower and using a longer decay. You can also add a pair of sine waves, tuned to be out-of-tune, in parallel with noise.
