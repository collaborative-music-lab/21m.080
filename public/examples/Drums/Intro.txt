Simple Drum Synthesis Techniques

Kick Drums and Hihats are often synthesized using basic synthesis techniques. The examples given here can also be modified to synthesize toms, snares, cymbals, and other percussive sound fx. 

These examples create Kick and HiHat classes, with the associated methods trigger() for the Kick, and triggerClosed() and triggerOpen() for the hihat. While making the classes is a bit verbose, once they are written it is easy to create and trigger kick and hat objects.
