Here are the basic steps involved in generating sound using Tone.js, and getting that sound to play from your computer.

You execute code by typing option-enter (max) or alt-enter (windows).
And you can execute a block of code by typing: 
* windows/linux: shift-alt-enter
* mac: shift-option-enter
* (a block is sequential lines of code with no blank lines between them)

You can also run all of the code in the codebox by clicking the 'Play' button.
