# Fourier Theorem Example

The Fourier theorem states that we can generate any complex periodic waveform just by adding up sine waves
* The sine waves must have frequencies which are harmonics of the fundamental
* Their amplitude and phase can be any values

This example shows how to combine 8 sine waves to generate the first 8 harmonics of sawtooth and square waves
