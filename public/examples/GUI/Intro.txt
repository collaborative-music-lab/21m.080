Example of different GUI objects. Available objects are:
* Dial: a rotary dial
* Slider: can be horizontal or vertical
* Button: A momentary button for triggering events
* Toggle: A toggle button
* RadioButton: An array of buttons for selecting options
* Line: To help organize your GUI. No output.
* Text: for arbitrary text. Can be assigned a mapto or callback for use as a button.

Note: most GUI objects work with either a 'mapto' Tone parameter, or a user-definable callback. See the reference for more information.
