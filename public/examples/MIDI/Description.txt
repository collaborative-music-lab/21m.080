## MIDI note messages

You can generate MIDI note messages by using a MIDI keyboard, or by clicking on the keyboard icon in the menu bar at the top of the code box and using your laptop keyboard. 

Every MIDI note has an on- and off- message (triggered when you press and release a key, respectively). You'll probably want to define separate functions to handle them. By default, incoming MIDI Note messages are printed to the console. You can define your own handlers to work with your synth:
* `setNoteOnHandler(( note, vel ) => { <your code here> })`
* `setNoteOffHandler(( note, vel) => { <your code here> })`

## MIDI CC messages

Continuous Controller messages are generated by controllers like dials and faders. You can assign your own handler to control parameters of your synth:
* `setCCHandler(( cc, value ) => { <your code here> })`

## MIDI Channels

By default, MIDI message handlers ignore the MIDI channel. You can choose to use channels just by including an optional third argument to any MIDI message handler, e.g.:
```
setNoteOnHandler(( note, vel, channel) => {
	if(channel == 1) trigger1()
	if(channel == 2) trigger2()
}
```
