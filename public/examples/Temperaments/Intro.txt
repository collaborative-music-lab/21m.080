Temperaments (or tunings) describe the numerical relationships between pitches. The most obvious way to create a temperament is to use simple ratios such as 3:2 or 5:4. However, simple techniques don't do well at making all intervals sound equally good, and making it possible to transpose freely.

For this reason, most western musical instruments or tuned to 12-tone equal temperament (or 12-tet). In this temperament, all notes are equally out of tune by a tiny amount. This small amount of dissance is accepted by most people.
