A simple convolution engine. Useful for creating reverbs, or for running a sound through a resonant body like a guitar. 

* Available IRs:
	* reverbs: 'hall_reverb.mp3', 'plate_reverb.mp3', 'spring_reverb.mp3'
	* amps: 'ampeg_amp.mp3', 'marshall_amp.mp3', 'voxAC30_amp.mp3'
	* guitar bodies: 'dreadnought_guitar.mp3', 'taylor_guitar.mp3', 'custom_guitar.mp3'
* to use amp and guitar IRs, set dry level to 0 and wet to 1
	* you also might need to boost the output using the right radiobutton
* signal path is:
	* synth -> dry -> output
	* synth -> wet -> convolver -> hpf -> lpf -> output
