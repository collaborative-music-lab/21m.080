## Primary properties and methods:
### Properties [unit]:
* attack: [seconds] The amount of time it takes for the envelope to go from 0 to it's maximum value.
* decay: [seconds] The amount of time after the attack that it takes for the envelope to fall to the sustain value. Decay must be greater than 0.
* sustain: [amplitude] The percent of the maximum value that the envelope rests at until the release is triggered.
* release: [seconds] The amount of time after the release is triggered it takes to reach 0. Value must be greater than 0.
### Methods:
* triggerAttack(): triggers the attack/decay/sustain portion of the envelope. 
* triggerRelease(): triggers the release portion of the envelope.
* triggerAttackRelease(sustainTime): triggers the attack/decay/sustain portion of the envelope, holds at the sustain level for sustainTime, then triggers the release portion of the envelope. sustainTime must be greater than 0.

## Additional properties and methods:
### Properties [unit]:
* attackCurve: [string] The shape of the attack stage. Options include :“linear”, “exponential”, “sine”.
* decayCurve: [string] The shape of the decay stage. Can be either “linear” or “exponential”.
* releaseCurve: [string] The shape of the release stage. Same options as attackCurve.
* value: returns the current value of the envelope. Good for use with console.log()

### Methods:
* get(): gets the object’s attributes. Good for use with console.log()
