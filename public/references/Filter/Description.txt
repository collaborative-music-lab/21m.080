### Primary properties and methods:
#### Properties [unit]:
* frequency: [Hertz] the cutoff frequency for the filter.
* Q: [around 0 to 40] The resonance or ‘Quality’ of the filter. 
  * This reflects how much the filter amplifies incoming signals at the cutoff frequency.
  * Be careful with Q values higher than 10 - it can get loud!

#### Methods:
* connect( destination ): sends the output of the filter to the input of the specified destination 

### Additional properties and methods:
#### Properties [unit]:
* type: [string] filter type
  * Available filter types are "lowpass", "highpass", "bandpass", "lowshelf", "highshelf", "notch", "allpass", or "peaking”
* rolloff: [decibel] the slope of the filter.
  * e.g., how quickly it attenuates frequencies past the cutoff frequency. Typical values are -12 or -24.

#### Methods:
* get(): gets the filter’s attributes. Good for use with console.log()
  * e.g. console.log( vcf.get() )
