### Mandatory Arguments
1. The argument to the Spectroscope constructor MUST be a valid html div. In our framework the name of the div will always be displayed above it. 
2. When connecting an audio source to the oscilloscope, the argument to connect() MUST be the name of the scope followed by .analyserNode, e.g. vco.connect( spectrum.analyserNode )
   1. The analyserNode is the audio object that does the actual analysis
### Primary Properties & Methods
#### Properties
* maxFrequency: [Hertz] Sets the maximum frequency displayed on the Spectroscope. default: 24000
#### Methods
* setFftSize(): [fft size, power of 2] This sets the size of the FFT, which affects the resolution of the scope. Higher values will display longer time frames, lower values will zoom in. This value must be a power of 2, and the maximum value is 32768. Default: 4096.
* start(): Begins drawing the waveform
* stop(): stops drawing the waveform
